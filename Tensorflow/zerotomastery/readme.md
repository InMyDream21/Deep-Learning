# TensorFlow Developer Course (Zerotomastery)
This is my take when i was taking the TensorFlow Developer course by ZerotoMastery at Udemy.
I've learned a lot and all of the notebook provided here is for educational purposes.
What I've learned from this course:
- Computer Vision (CNN) with TensorFlow.
- Natural Language (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and also replicating the n-beats paper).
- Time-series Forecasting.

Here is my certificate:
